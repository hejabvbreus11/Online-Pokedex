# Online-Pokedex
# System Introduction

I am a wild fan for Pokémon games so for this project, I would like to build a website integrated as a counterpart of pokedex. Users who logged into this website will see distinct contents specialized by their appetites, which means users will be distributed to different predefined groups at the moment of signing up. Besides, users’ search operation will not take more than three steps and they can sort and filter their search result easily.
Detailed data for up to 721 pokemons are carefully collected into database and will be performed in context of general info pages and detailed info pages with excellent view effect. Additionally, users are allowed to sort and order the pokemons on panel by diverse attributes. For any advanced requirements, users can also resort to the search bar with which the users can search specialized set of pokemons.

# Scope
The Pokédex ( illustrated Pokémon encyclopedia) is a digital encyclopedia created by Professor Oak as an invaluable tool to Trainers in the Pokémon world. It gives information about all Pokémon for more than 721 in the world that are contained in its database, although it differs in how it acquires and presents information over the different media. However, they are also only given to a few Trainers at a time, generally to the ones that are felt to have exceptional potential and skill. There are different types of Pokédexes and each Pokédex is special to a specific region.
Pokédex entries typically describe a Pokémon in only two or three sentences. They may give background information on the habitat or activities of a Pokémon in the wild or other information on the Pokémon's history or anatomy. Pokédex entries also include height, weight, cry, footprint (prior to Generation VI), location, other forms, and a picture of the Pokémon.
In order to accommodate the pokedex system to web media and simplify the complexity to build such a giant database, I will limit the number of pokemon in generation 1&2&3 for almost 386 and more or less, some features like pokemon voice and footprint may be neglected due to technical reasons.
